# Emoji-Deleter-From-Files-Name
When I transfer files from my computer to my phone, sometimes the transformation stop and windows just can't detecte my phone and it crashs, 
that happened repeatedly, then I notice when ever there is emoji or weired character in the file name it crashs. 
So, I just made a simple program that delete any emoji or weired character in all files name.
